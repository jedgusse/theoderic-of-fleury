# "*Monachus et Sacerdos Peregrinus*: A Stylometric and Contextual Re-investigation of the Work of Theoderic of Fleury/Trier/Amorbach (fl. 970s-1020s)"

This repository comprises the code, corpora and figures for the article "*Monachus et Sacerdos Peregrinus*: A Stylometric and Contextual Re-investigation of the Work of Theoderic of Fleury/Trier/Amorbach (fl. 970s-1020s)", forthcoming.

The paper deploys a double method of stylometric and contextual analysis in order to review and refine historiographical arguments about the authorship by the cleric-turned-monk Thierry of Fleury/Trier/Amorbach (fl. 970-1020s) of a range of hagiographies, sermons, exegetical works, and a customary of the abbey of Fleury. In doing so, it seeks to establish a comprehension of Theoderic’s written output in much sharper contour than was hitherto possible. And it also relies on the new evidence yielded by this analysis to reconstruct in greater detail than before Theoderic’s biographical and literary trajectory, and to to problematize his exceptionally mobile status, his unusual authorial profile, and the scope and contents of his works in light of the shifting contexts and commissioners that nourished his activities as an author. In doing all these things, this study raises new questions about authorship and literary networks in the decades on either side of the year 1000, and offers a new interdisciplinary approach to reconstructing these realities. 

# Corpus Details

Both the Python code and the texts discussed in this article will be made available in open access on GitHub, with a limited number of exceptions when it comes to copright-protected textual data (cf. corpus -> restricted).

# Code and Visualizations

The code above is written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/), and requires a number of packages collected under the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution. 

Clone this repository locally (i.e. download it in a convenient location). The texts under scrutiny are already in the data folder. In the terminal, change your current directory to the theoderic-of-fleury folder, and run the Python script simply by typing the following command:

```python code/main.py```
